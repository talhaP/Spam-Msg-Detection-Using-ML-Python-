# Spam-Msg-Detection-Using-ML-Python-
This is my first Machine learning mini project. 
I make spam msg detection which have more than 90% accuracy score.
I take dataset from kaagle.
I vectorise data using CountVectorizer.
I use MultinomialNB because this machine learning is good for text classification.
I give UI using HTML and CSS.
I used flask api to build simple web applicaion.The Flask API serves as an interface for users to interact with the machine learning model.
